# bojler

Bojler is a simple boilerplating tool built for Go.

**bojler is very early in the experimental stage**

Bojler is envisioned as a GoLang scaffold/boilerplating tool that initializes projects or parts of a project from some local or remote parametrized and structured repository.

Following rules define and focus bojler functionality:

* Know only about Go and know it well, everything else is just parametrized text.
* Use AST to tokenize go source and provide a unified mechanism for rewriting it.

## Nomenclature

Further on, the following terms are described as bojler functionality:

* repository - a local or remote location to a directory containing a structured
layout of some boilerplate code.
